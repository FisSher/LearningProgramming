If you are reading this, it means you are curious to know what I am doing here.
This repo is just for tracking my practical python skills so I don't lose my files (again).
Sometimes I have an idea and write 2 lines of code, then I lose them in ... somewhere.
Friendly reminder: save all your files togheter. 
Cheers ! :D
